Please provide the input text you want me to insert. I need the actual content to proceed with creating the outline. 

For example, you could provide:

* **The full text of the original plan and critique:**  This will give me the most context and allow me to work with all the information you've already provided.
* **Specific points from the critique:** If you only want me to focus on certain aspects of the critique, please highlight those. For example, "Focus on making the characters more unique and giving them more depth."
* **New ideas for the outline:**  If you have any new thoughts or directions you want to explore, share them with me!

Once I have the input, I can help you create a more original and engaging outline for your book.
